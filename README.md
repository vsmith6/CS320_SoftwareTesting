How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

     The code, program, or software can be ensured as functional and secure by ensuring that the program contains only what is
     specified by the user as well as ensuring that the appropriate testing has been completed.  The programming language and environment
     should be chosen based on the needs of the user and their project. Appropriate testing assures that the program has met security
     specifications and provides living documentation for future use and accountability. 
     
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

     Interpreting the items that a user is looking for in their program and establishing relevant classes that are approved by the user
     will ensure that the program is only doing the work that is expected.  Objects created should be ones that are necessary in providing
     a solution for the user. Creating documentation that details what is expected from the program and what the program will contain 
     in each class is good to complete before any coding is completed to assure that the requirements are being met.

How do I approach designing software?

     Designing software is approached by providing a user a secure, functional program that will meet their needs and help them
     to achieve the work that they need to accomplish. The design of the software should be documented and approved by the user 
     before any coding is completed to ensure that there are no missing pieces and to eliminate any misunderstandings. The functionality
     of the code should be tested to ensure that all of the requirements are there and it is working as expected.  The testing that is 
     done will ensure that the original functionality will remain intact in case of any future changes as well as provide documentation 
     for future developers.
